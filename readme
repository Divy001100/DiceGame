Dice Game
Overview
This is a simple JavaScript-based dice game where two players roll a virtual die, and the player with the higher number wins. The game is designed to run in a web browser and updates the webpage dynamically with the results of each roll.

Features
Random Dice Roll: Each player rolls a die with numbers ranging from 1 to 6, generated using the Math.random() function.
Dynamic Image Update: The corresponding dice images are dynamically updated on the webpage based on the result of the roll.
Winner Announcement: The webpage displays the winner (Player 1 or Player 2) or declares a draw if both players roll the same number.
Files :
js was embedded within html using <style>, however it could be done using an external js sheet as well.

Code Explanation
Random Number Generation
The random number for each player's dice roll is generated using the following code:

javascript
var randomNum = Math.floor(Math.random() * 6) + 1;
Math.random() generates a random floating-point number between 0 (inclusive) and 1 (exclusive).
Multiplying by 6 scales this number to a range between 0 and 5.999.
Math.floor() rounds the result down to the nearest whole number, giving a range between 0 and 5.
Adding 1 shifts the range to 1â€“6, simulating a dice roll.
Image Update
The dice image is updated dynamically using the setAttribute method:

javascript
document.querySelector("img.img1").setAttribute("src", randomsrc);
randomsrc is the file path of the image corresponding to the rolled number.
querySelector("img.img1") selects the image element with class img1.
setAttribute("src", randomsrc) updates the src attribute of the image to display the correct dice face.
Winner Declaration
The winner is determined by comparing the two random numbers:

javascript
C
if (randomNum > randomNum2) {
  document.querySelector("h1").innerHTML = "Player 1 Wins!";
} else if (randomNum < randomNum2) {
  document.querySelector("h1").innerHTML = "Player 2 Wins!";
} else {
  document.querySelector("h1").innerHTML = "It's a Draw!";
}
Depending on which number is higher, the corresponding player is declared the winner.
If both numbers are equal, the game is declared a draw.
